### Hi!

Welcome to my blog! I'm *delighted* you've stopped by. Here, I share my passions and interests, primarily focusing on building with .NET Core applications. But that's not allâ€”I'm also passionate about photography and electronics. I'm currently working on creating a public album of my photographs, and I look forward to sharing that with you soon, along with links to view my pictures.

My posts are pretty diverse. Some are technical, covering topics like .NET and AWS, while others are personal notes or thoughts I want to remember for the future. Feel free to explore my posts; if any of them resonate with you or prove useful, then I've achieved what I set out to do. Thanks again for visiting, and I hope you find something here that sparks your interest or helps you in some way. Enjoy your stay!

If you like the pictures above, the one that links to my posts was taken at *Bradley Beach, NJ*. The image leading to my tags was captured at *Lake Agnes in Banff National Park*, and the one directing to Categories was shot at *Watkins Glen, NY*. 

If you haven't visited Banff National Park yet, I highly recommend seeing it at least once in your life. It is the most beautiful place I've ever visited. Watkins Glen also has its own unique charm.
