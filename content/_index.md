### Hi!

Welcome to my blog! I'm *delighted* you've stopped by. Here, I share my passions and interests, primarily focusing on building with .NET Core applications. But that's not allâ€”I'm also passionate about photography and electronics. I'm currently working on creating a public album of my photographs, and I look forward to sharing that with you soon, along with links to view my pictures.

My posts are pretty diverse. Some are technical, covering topics like .NET and AWS, while others are personal notes or thoughts I want to remember for the future. Feel free to explore my posts; if any of them resonate with you or prove useful, then I've achieved what I set out to do. Thanks again for visiting, and I hope you find something here that sparks your interest or helps you in some way. Enjoy your stay!
